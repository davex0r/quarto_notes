In the language I have been developing in the last few notes, I would say that $z_1(t)$ and $z_2(t)$ are the basis functions and the dynamics of $a$ and $b$ are projections onto these basis functions.  \n\nIt is clear in this simple example that the basis functions are defined by the eigenvalues and the projection is defined by the eigenvectors.  Thus if we change the eigenvalues without changing the eigenvectors we adjust the basis functions ad if we change the eigenvectors while keeping constant eigenvalues we change the projection. \n\nLets now consider the action of an enzyme which lowers the activation energy barrier for the reaction.  This results in a proportional increase in both $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$\n$$\n\\large\n\\ce{a<=>[{r\\lambda}][{r\\nu}]b}\n$$\nThe eigenvector associated with the 0 eigenvalue is then $\\frac{r\\nu}{r\\lambda} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\lambda}$, and is thus unchanged. However, the non-zero eigenvalue is now $-(r\\nu+r\\lambda)=-r(\\nu+\\lambda)$.  This results in the second basis function changing to $$ \\large z_2(t) = z_2(0)e^{-r(\\nu+\\lambda)t}$$Because the dynamics of $a$ and $b$ are linear combinations of $z_1$ and $z_2$ and the dynamics of $z_2$ are now much faster (by a factor of $r$) the resulting dynamics of a and b will be faster, but the resulting steady state concentrations of $a$ and $b$ will be unchanged.  This matches our intuition based on activation energy changes in equilibrium systems. \n\nAlternatively, in this simple system, we can adjust the projections without changing the basis functions.  We do this by adjusting $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$ such that their sum stays constant.  This corresponds to a process which maintains the *total flux* in the system but adjusts the flux balance[^1] (this necessarily corresponds to binding energy differences here). $$\\begin{align} \\lambda \\to (\\lambda + r) \\\\ \\nu\\to(\\nu-r)\\end{align}$$This changes the steady state ratio of $a$ and $b$ but leaves the kinetics unchanged.  This is because the basis functions are unchanged: $$ \\large z_2(t) = z_2(0)e^{-(\\nu+r+\\lambda-r)t} = z_2(0)e^{-(\\nu+\\lambda)t}$$This uncoupling of the dynamics into independent observable functions $z$ is always possible for Laplacian dynamics.  To connect it to some of the concepts introduced in previous notes, we can think of the functions $z$ as observable functions of the *natural coordinates* $a$ and $b$, where each observable function has dynamics that are closed on its own 1D subspace (this is a restatement of the uncoupling condition).  We can also think of the dynamics of $a$ and $b$ as being projections onto the basis functions defined by $z$.  Interestingly the basis functions $z$ define a spectrum of time-scales for the dynamics because the dynamics of the molecular concentrations will be linear combinations of the basis functions defined by the eigenvalue spectrum.  In the next note I will explore how these notions can be applied to larger networks, and look at some connections to kinetic regime vs energetic regime proofreading, building finally to connections to orthogonality. \n\n[^1]:This possibly implies the existence of a basic chemical reaction modification (like an enzyme) that shifts the flux balance of a reaction while preserving the total reaction flux.  I could not think of a ready biological example of such a thing, but I would keep an eye out for something that fits this.\n\n",
