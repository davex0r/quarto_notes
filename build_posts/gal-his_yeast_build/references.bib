  abstract = "The recruitment of a gene to a foreign regulatory system is a
              major evolutionary event that can lead to novel phenotypes.
              However, the evolvability potential of cells depends on their
              ability to cope with challenges presented by gene recruitment. To
              study this ability, we combined synthetic gene recruitment with
              continuous culture and online measurements of the metabolic and
              regulatory dynamics over long timescales. The gene HIS3 from the
              histidine synthesis pathway was recruited to the GAL system,
              responsible for galactose utilization in the yeast S. cerevisiae.
              Following a switch from galactose to glucose--from induced to
              repressed conditions of the GAL system--in histidine-lacking
              chemostats (where the recruited HIS3 is essential), the regulatory
              system reprogrammed to adaptively tune HIS3 expression, allowing
              the cells to grow competitively in pure glucose. The adapted state
              was maintained for hundreds of generations in various
              environments. The timescales involved and the reproducibility of
              separate experiments render spontaneous mutations an unlikely
              underlying mechanism. Essentially all cells could adapt, excluding
              selection over a genetically variable population. The results
              reveal heritable adaptation induced by the exposure to glucose.
              They demonstrate that genetic regulatory networks have the
              potential to support highly demanding events of gene recruitment.",

  abstract = {Natural selection dictates that cells constantly adapt to dynamically changing environments in a context-dependent manner. Gene-regulatory networks often mediate the cellular response to perturbation, and an understanding of cellular adaptation will require experimental approaches aimed at subjecting cells to a dynamic environment that mimics their natural habitat. Here we monitor the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic gene regulation to periodic changes in the external carbon source by using a microfluidic platform that allows precise, dynamic control over environmental conditions. We show that the metabolic system acts as a low-pass filter that reliably responds to a slowly changing environment, while effectively ignoring fast fluctuations. The sensitive low-frequency response was significantly faster than in predictions arising from our computational modelling, and this discrepancy was resolved by the discovery that two key galactose transcripts possess half-lives that depend on the carbon source. Finally, to explore how induction characteristics affect frequency response, we compare two S. cerevisiae strains and show that they have the same frequency response despite having markedly different induction properties. This suggests that although certain characteristics of the complex networks may differ when probed in a static environment, the system has been optimized for a robust response to a dynamically changing environment.},

When wild-type (wt) GFP was expressed in               C. albicans,               it was not possible to detect fluorescence or a translation product for the wt protein. Since this was probably due in part to the presence of the non-canonical CTG serine codon in the               Aequorea               sequence, this codon was changed to the leucine codon TTG.               C. albicans               cells expressing this construct contained GFP mRNA but were non-fluorescent and contained no detectable translation product. Hence a codon-optimized GFP gene was constructed in which all of the 239 amino acids are encoded by optimal codons for               C albicans.               In this gene were also incorporated two previously identified mutations in the chromophore that increase GFP fluorescence.               C. albicans               cells expressing this yeast-enhanced GFP gene (yEGFP3) are fluorescent and contain GFP protein. yEGFP3 can be used as a versatile reporter of gene expression in               C. albicans               and               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               and the optimized GFP described here should have broad applications in these and other fungal species.},

In this respect, experimental evolution in continuous cultures provides advantages over commonly used sequential batch‐culture protocols because continuous cultures allow for more accurate control over the induced selective environment. However, commercial continuous‐culture systems are large and expensive, while available DIY continuous‐culture systems are not versatile enough to allow for multiple sensors and rigorous stirring.                                                                          We present a modular continuous‐culture system that adopts the commonly used                     GL45                     glass laboratory bottle as a bioreactor vessel. Our design offers three advantages: first, it is equipped with a large head plate, fitting two sensors and seven input/output ports, enabling the customization of the system for many running modes (chemostat, auxostat, etc.). Second, the bioreactor is small (25–250~ml), which makes it feasible to run many replicates in parallel. Third, bioreactor modules can be coupled by uni‐ or bi‐directional flows to induce spatiotemporal variation in selection. These features result in a particularly flexible culturing platform that facilitates the investigation of a broad range of evolutionary and ecological questions.                                                                        To illustrate the versatility of our culturing system, we outline two evolution experiments that impose a temporally or spatially variable regime of selection. The first experiment illustrates how controlled temporal variation in resource availability can be utilized to select for anticipatory switching. The second experiment illustrates a spatially structured morbidostat setup that is designed to probe epistatic interactions between adaptive mutations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how sensor data can be used to stabilize selection pressures or track evolutionary adaptation.                                                     Evolution experiments in which populations are exposed to controlled spatiotemporal variation, are essential to gain insight into the process of adaptation and the mechanisms that constrain evolution. Continuous‐culture systems, like the one presented here, offer control over key environmental parameters and establish a well‐defined regime of selection. As such, they create the opportunity to expose evolutionary constraints in the form of phenotypic trade‐offs, contributing to a mechanistic understanding of adaptive evolution.},

Here we present a benchtop stirred continuous culture bioreactor capable of withstanding temperatures ranging from 25 to 120°C and pressures as high as 69 MPa. The system is configured to allow the employment of media enriched in dissolved gases, under oxic or anoxic conditions, while permitting periodic sampling of the incubated organisms with minimal physical/chemical disturbance inside the reactor. In a pilot experiment, the fermentative growth of the thermopiezophilic bacterium               Marinitoga piezophila               was investigated continuously for 382 h at 65°C and at pressures ranging from 0.1 to 40 MPa while the medium flow rate was varied from 2 to 0.025 ml/min. The enhanced growth observed at 30 and 40 MPa and 0.025 ml/min supports the pressure preferences of               M. piezophila               when grown fermentatively. This assay successfully demonstrates the capabilities of the bioreactor for continuous culturing at a variety of dilution rates, pressures, and temperatures. We anticipate that this technology will accelerate our understanding of the physiological and metabolic status of microorganisms under temperature, pressure, and energy regimes resembling those of the Earth's piezosphere.},

  abstract = {This research aimed to assess how the partial removal of carbon dioxide affects fermentations to provide a better understanding of how the manipulation of carbon dioxide concentration can be used to optimize industrial fermentations. To achieve this, fermentation kinetics, fermentation metabolic products, and yeast stress indicators were analyzed throughout ongoing brewing fermentations conducted under partial vacuum with atmospheric pressure controls. The partial vacuum reduced the solubility of carbon dioxide in the media and decreased the time necessary to reach carbon dioxide saturation. The effect was an increased rate of fermentation, and significantly more viable cells produced under vacuum pressure compared to controls. Ethanol, glycerol, and volatile organic compound concentrations were all significantly increased under partial vacuum, while indicators of yeast stress (trehalose) were reduced. Additionally, as the number of yeast cells was higher under partial vacuum, less sugar was consumed per volume of yeast cell. This study measured fermentation kinetics, metabolic products, and yeast health to holistically assess the effect of partial vacuum during a batch fermentation and found significant differences in each that can be individually exploited by researchers and industry.

However, researchers must determine which GFP is the most suitable for a specific host. Here, we expressed GFPs from several sources in codon-optimized and non-codon-optimized forms in the yeast               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               , which represents an ideal eukaryotic model. Surprisingly, codon-optimized mWasabi and mNeonGreen, which are typically the brightest GFPs, emitted less green fluorescence than did the other five codon-optimized GFPs tested in               S. cerevisiae               . Further, commercially available GFPs that have been optimized for mammalian codon usage (e.g., EGFP, AcGFP1 and TagGFP2) unexpectedly exhibited extremely low expression levels in               S. cerevisiae               . In contrast, codon-optimization of the GFPs for               S. cerevisiae               markedly increased their expression levels, and the fluorescence intensity of the cells increased by a maximum of 101-fold. Among the tested GFPs, the codon-optimized monomeric mUkG1 from soft coral showed the highest levels of both expression and fluorescence. Finally, the expression of this protein as a fusion-tagged protein successfully improved the reporting system’s ability to sense signal transduction and protein–protein interactions in               S. cerevisiae               and increased the detection rates of target cells using flow cytometry.},

While the biochemical networks involved in energy transduction are well-characterized, the energetic costs and constraints for specific cellular processes remain largely unknown. In particular, what are the energy budgets of cells? What are the constraints and limits energy flows impose on cellular processes? Do cells operate near these limits, and if so how do energetic constraints impact cellular functions? Physics has provided many tools to study nonequilibrium systems and to define physical limits, but applying these tools to cell biology remains a challenge. Physical bioenergetics, which resides at the interface of nonequilibrium physics, energy metabolism, and cell biology, seeks to understand how much energy cells are using, how they partition this energy between different cellular processes, and the associated energetic constraints. Here we review recent advances and discuss open questions and challenges in physical bioenergetics.},
