  abstract = "For various experimental applications, microbial cultures at
              defined, constant densities are highly advantageous over simple
              batch cultures. Due to high costs, however, devices for continuous
              culture at freely defined densities still experience limited use.
              We have developed a small-scale turbidostat for research purposes,
              which is manufactured from inexpensive components and 3D printed
              parts. A high degree of spatial system integration and a graphical
              user interface provide user-friendly operability. The used optical
              density feedback control allows for constant continuous culture at
              a wide range of densities and offers to vary culture volume and
              dilution rates without additional parametrization. Further, a
              recursive algorithm for on-line growth rate estimation has been
              implemented. The employed Kalman filtering approach based on a
              very general state model retains the flexibility of the used
              control type and can be easily adapted to other bioreactor
              designs. Within several minutes it can converge to robust,
              accurate growth rate estimates. This is particularly useful for
              directed evolution experiments or studies on metabolic challenges,
              as it allows direct monitoring of the population fitness.",
