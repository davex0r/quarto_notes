  abstract = "Cycles of nutrients (N, P, etc.) and resources (C) are a defining
              emergent feature of ecosystems. Cycling plays a critical role in
              determining ecosystem structure at all scales, from microbial
              communities to the entire biosphere. Stable cycles are essential
              for ecosystem persistence because they allow resources and
              nutrients to be regenerated. Therefore, a central problem in
              ecology is understanding how ecosystems are organized to sustain
              robust cycles. Addressing this problem quantitatively has proved
              challenging because of the difficulties associated with
              manipulating ecosystem structure while measuring cycling. We
              address this problem using closed microbial ecosystems (CES),
              hermetically sealed microbial consortia provided with only light.
              We develop a technique for quantifying carbon cycling in
              hermetically sealed microbial communities and show that CES
              composed of an alga and diverse bacterial consortia self-organize
              to robustly cycle carbon for months. Comparing replicates of
              diverse CES, we find that carbon cycling does not depend strongly
              on the taxonomy of the bacteria present. Moreover, despite strong
              taxonomic differences, self-organized CES exhibit a conserved set
              of metabolic capabilities. Therefore, an emergent carbon cycle
              enforces metabolic but not taxonomic constraints on ecosystem
              organization. Our study helps establish closed microbial
              communities as model ecosystems to study emergent function and
              persistence in replicate systems while controlling community
              composition and the environment.",
